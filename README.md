Trying to learn about server/client in python. Taking a hobby i like Magic The Gathering.

I'm aiming to create a board, where multiple clients (player) can place cards on the board. No rules are going to be set.

The server must listen to all clients, and broadcast the state of the board to all clients, and display all decks correctly
